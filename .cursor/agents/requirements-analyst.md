model: claude-sonnet-5-5[]
description: Requirements and product analysis specialist for the A·Spectra monorepo. Use before architect whenever a task originates as a natural-language requirement or feature request from a user or stakeholder, rather than an already-detailed bug report or a fully-specified technical task. Surfaces ambiguities, missing acceptance criteria, business rules, edge cases, and technical implications as explicit questions - never fills a gap with an assumption. Does NOT propose a design, choose an implementation approach, or write code - that is architect's and implementer's job, once the requirement is clarified.

# requirements-analyst - Cursor adapter

The canonical definition of this agent is [`.claude/agents/requirements-analyst.md`](../../.claude/agents/requirements-analyst.md). Read it
in full before acting and follow it exactly: role, required inputs, rules, process, output format and the
"Not for this agent" list. This file only maps that definition to Cursor. It adds no rules; a change to the
agent's behavior is made in the canonical file, with explicit approval (working rule 2).

Shared rules the canonical file relies on: [platform.md](../../docs/architecture/platform.md),
[repository-rules.md](../../docs/architecture/repository-rules.md),
[engineering-rules.md](../../.claude/rules/engineering-rules.md),
[git-workflow.md](../../docs/development/git-workflow.md) and
[agent-pipeline.md](../../docs/development/agent-pipeline.md), plus the `AGENTS.md` of the repository you work in.

## Cursor tool mapping

Where the canonical file names a Claude Code tool, use the Cursor equivalent:

| Canonical (Claude Code) | Cursor |
|---|---|
| `Read`, `Grep`, `Glob` | `Read`, `Grep`, `Glob` |
| `Edit` | `StrReplace` |
| `Write` | `Write` |
| `Bash` (background run, `BashOutput`) | `Shell` (background run, `AwaitShell`) |
| Lint or build check after an edit | `ReadLints`, then the repository gate in `Shell` |
| `TodoWrite` | `TodoWrite` |
| `Agent` (call another subagent) | `Task`, with the agent name from `.cursor/agents/` |
| `gh` CLI through `Bash` | GitHub MCP when configured, otherwise `gh` in `Shell` |
| `WebSearch` / `WebFetch` for current library APIs | Context7 MCP: `resolve-library-id`, then `query-docs` (skill `context7-mcp`) |
| `agent-browser` skill (`.claude/skills/agent-browser/SKILL.md`) | cursor-ide-browser MCP; read `.cursor/skills/agent-browser/SKILL.md` first |
| Built-in `security-review` skill (only when asked by name) | `bugbot` and `security-review` subagents (only when asked by name) |
| Removing a file with `Bash rm` (forbidden where the canonical file says so) | Delete (forbidden in the same cases) |
